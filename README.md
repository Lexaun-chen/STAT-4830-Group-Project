## Summary
This project addresses the problem of predicting consumer hotel preferences based on personalized offer sets and relevant hotel and consumer features, using real-world data from Expedia. Two modeling frameworks were explored: a mixture preference learning model optimized via the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, including neural network extensions, and a matrix completion approach based on low-rank factorization methods. The findings indicate that linear models generally outperform neural networks due to limited data size and inherent linearity in consumer decision-making. Additionally, the matrix completion methods proved robust and effective, particularly when incorporating bias-aware initialization and using the Huber loss function to handle sparsity and noisy data. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into modeling consumer preferences and demonstrates practical methods suitable for predicting choices in large-scale recommendation systems.

## Repository Structure Overview
#### src/
Contains the core implementation files, such as frank_wolfe.py and adam_expedia_completion.py, which define the main classes (Problem_FrankWolfe, etc.) and functions used for training and evaluating the preference prediction model.
#### notebooks/
Includes cleaned Jupyter notebooks used for Frank-Wolfe Algorithm and matrix completion. These notebooks import from src/ and provide step-by-step execution of the data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization. There is a readme file summarizing the function and work of demos.
#### tests/
Includes test files and datasets (e.g., train_28-32_10000.csv, test_28-32_1000.csv) used for evaluating model performance and verifying functionality. 
#### docs/
Stores final presentation slides
#### report.md
The final project report summarizing the problem background, modeling approach, empirical results, and key findings.
#### requirements.txt
Lists the Python dependencies required to reproduce the results in a consistent environment (e.g., torch, numpy, pandas).
#### development_history/
Including the past code, notebooks,tests, reports and slides(including self-critiques), figures and diagrams used in reports before and exploration of LLM.

## Setup Instructions
We highly recommend using Google Colab to view and run our final demo. It handles all required installations automatically‚Äîjust click ‚ÄúRuntime ‚Üí Run all‚Äù, and the full pipeline will execute without any setup.
If you prefer to run the code locally, follow these steps:
1. Prepare a Jupyter Environment
Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed and properly configured with a Python 3.9+ kernel.
2. Install Dependencies
Use the provided requirements.txt to install all necessary packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download Source Files
Make sure you have the following files locally:
The notebook: notebooks/Demo.ipynb
Source code in src/
Any scripts or test files if you want to run from command line or verify with pytest
4. Set the Python Path (if needed)
Ensure your Python environment can locate the src/ module. If needed, add the project root to your PYTHONPATH or append manually in the notebook.
5. Run the Notebook
Open and execute the notebook:
It will import functions from src/, train the model, and display the results‚Äîincluding convergence plots and ranking tables.

## Setup Instructions

We **highly recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** to view and run our final demo. It automatically handles all dependencies and environment setup.  
Simply open the notebook and click:

```
Runtime ‚Üí Run all
```

The full pipeline will execute, including downloading data, model training, and result visualization.

### Running Locally

If you'd like to run the code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare a Jupyter Environment**  
   Make sure [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is installed and configured with a Python **3.9+** kernel.
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use the provided `requirements.txt` to install all necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download Source Files**  
   Make sure you have the following files in your local directory:
   - The notebook: `notebooks/Demo.ipynb`
   - Source code in `src/`
   - Any additional scripts or test files (optional)
4. **Set the Python Path (if needed)**  
   Ensure your environment can locate the `src/` module:
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append('../src')
   ```If needed, add the project root to your PYTHONPATH or append manually in the notebook.
5. Run the Notebook
5. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open and execute `Demo.ipynb`:
   - It will import functions from `src/`
   - Train the model and display results
   - Include convergence plots, evaluation metrics, and ranking tables

### Dataset Access

All datasets required by the demo are **hosted in the `test/` folder of our GitHub repository**, and are **automatically loaded via URL** in the notebook.  
There is no need for manual download or local storage.

### GPU Support (Colab)

Our entire pipeline is compatible with **Google Colab GPU runtime**, and runs on **T4 GPUs** by default.

Training and evaluation steps have been optimized for T4 hardware.  
You‚Äôll benefit from accelerated matrix operations, especially during SVD and model fitting phases.


## Running the Code
The entire final results can be executed seamlessly in Google Colab with one click.
Our final notebook automatically imports all core functions from the src/ directory and performs end-to-end training, evaluation, and visualization. Unit tests from the tests/ folder can also be executed within the notebook. 
To run the project: üëâ Click ‚ÄúRuntime ‚Üí Run all‚Äù in Colab ‚Äî everything will install and execute automatically, no manual setup required.
For more details and a breakdown of each step, see the Colab demo section.
