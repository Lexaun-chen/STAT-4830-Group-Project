# 1. Problem Statement 

## 1.1 Overview
This week, we incorporated item features into our regression model to better specify the utility values of different items. By doing so, we aim to enhance the explanatory power of our model and improve its ability to predict the likelihood of people purchasing items not included in their previous offer set.
Additionally, we utilized a real-world dataset from Expedia, dividing it into training and testing subsets for model evaluation. To analyze the problem, we applied both linear regression and a neural network framework, comparing their performance and insights.

## 1.2 Background
Expedia offers thousands of hotels, each characterized by attributes such as price, number of rooms, and available space. However, not all hotels are presented to every consumer; we only observe a consumer's choice within their personalized offer set. Our objective is to model consumer decision-making over the broader universal set of options and to predict the likelihood of a consumer selecting a hotel that was not included in their initial offer set.

To address this, we draw upon the concept of utility maximization, a cornerstone of economic theory. Assuming rational behavior, we posit that consumers evaluate hotels based on their utility, which is determined by the features of each option. By estimating these utility values, we aim to build a model that captures consumer choice behavior more accurately and supports the development of enhanced recommendation systems, thereby improving the match between consumer preferences and offered options.
