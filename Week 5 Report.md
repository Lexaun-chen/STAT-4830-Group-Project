# 1. Problem Statement 

## 1.1 Overview
This week, we incorporated item features into our regression model to better specify the utility values of different items. By doing so, we aim to enhance the explanatory power of our model and improve its ability to predict the likelihood of people purchasing items not included in their previous offer set.
Additionally, we utilized a real-world dataset from Expedia, dividing it into training and testing subsets for model evaluation. To analyze the problem, we applied both linear regression and a neural network framework, comparing their performance and insights.
